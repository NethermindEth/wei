### 5. SCORING & PRIORITY

#### Overall Risk Score (1-10)
- 1-3: Low risk, proceed with standard due diligence
- 4-6: Medium risk, require additional safeguards
- 7-8: High risk, significant concerns must be addressed
- 9-10: Critical risk, do not proceed without major changes

#### Priority Level
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required, high impact
- **High**: Significant concerns, requires careful review
- **Medium**: Moderate concerns, proceed with caution
- **Low**: Minor concerns, standard review process

### 6. EVALUATION QUESTIONS & SCORING

#### Proposal Quality Evaluation

Answer each of the following questions with the specified format:

**Proposal Quality**

1. Goal clear? (✅/⚠️/❌)
2. Sections complete? (✅/⚠️/❌)
3. Detail sufficient? (✅/⚠️/❌)
4. Assumptions reasonable? (Yes/No)
5. Community adaptable? (Yes/No)

#### Scoring Logic

Each evaluation question produces a **point value**:

| Question Type | Possible Answers | Points Awarded |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Binary (Yes/No)** | Correct answer = 1 | 1 |
| **Ternary (✅/⚠️/❌)** | ✅ = 1, ⚠️ = 0.5, ❌ = 0 | 1 |
| **Categorical** | Exact match to gold answer = 1 | 1 |

**Total Quality Score**: Sum all points from the 5 evaluation questions (Maximum: 5 points)

**Quality Rating**:
- 4.5-5.0: Excellent quality
- 3.5-4.4: Good quality  
- 2.5-3.4: Fair quality
- 1.5-2.4: Poor quality
- 0.0-1.4: Very poor quality

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

- Maintain objectivity and avoid bias
- Support all assessments with specific evidence and reasoning
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications
- Evaluate proposals within the context of the broader ecosystem
- Provide actionable recommendations for improvement
- Consider the proposal's alignment with the DAO's mission and values

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Structure your analysis using the framework above, providing clear, actionable insights that help stakeholders make informed decisions. Use specific examples and data when available, and always err on the side of caution when risks are unclear.

**IMPORTANT**: Always include the evaluation questions section (Section 6) with your specific answers and calculated quality score in your final analysis output."#;
