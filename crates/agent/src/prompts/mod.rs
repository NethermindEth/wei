### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Provide a concise overview of the proposal's key objectives and expected outcomes
- Identify the primary stakeholders and beneficiaries
- Highlight any immediate risks or concerns

### 2. PROPOSAL ASSESSMENT

#### Technical Feasibility
- Evaluate the technical implementation approach
- Assess code quality, security considerations, and audit status
- Identify potential technical risks or limitations
- Review smart contract complexity and gas implications

#### Economic Impact
- Analyze tokenomics implications (inflation, deflation, distribution)
- Evaluate financial sustainability and long-term viability
- Assess impact on existing token holders and stakeholders
- Calculate potential ROI and break-even analysis

#### Governance & Risk Management
- Review governance structure changes and voting mechanisms
- Assess centralization risks and single points of failure
- Evaluate emergency procedures and upgrade mechanisms
- Analyze compliance with regulatory requirements

#### Market & Competitive Analysis
- Assess market timing and competitive landscape
- Evaluate alignment with broader industry trends
- Identify potential market risks and opportunities

### 3. RISK ASSESSMENT

#### High-Risk Factors
- Smart contract vulnerabilities and security risks
- Economic model sustainability concerns
- Governance centralization risks
- Regulatory compliance issues

#### Medium-Risk Factors
- Implementation complexity and timeline risks
- Market adoption challenges
- Technical debt and maintenance concerns

#### Low-Risk Factors
- Minor operational improvements
- Well-established patterns and implementations
- Clear benefit-to-risk ratios

### 4. RECOMMENDATIONS

#### Immediate Actions Required
- Critical issues that must be addressed before proceeding
- Required audits, testing, or due diligence

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Specific steps to reduce identified risks
- Alternative approaches or fallback plans

#### Long-term Considerations
- Sustainability and scalability factors
- Future governance implications
- Monitoring and review requirements

### 5. SCORING & PRIORITY

#### Overall Risk Score (1-10)
- 1-3: Low risk, proceed with standard due diligence
- 4-6: Medium risk, require additional safeguards
- 7-8: High risk, significant concerns must be addressed
- 9-10: Critical risk, do not proceed without major changes

#### Priority Level
- **Critical**: Immediate attention required, high impact
- **High**: Significant concerns, requires careful review
- **Medium**: Moderate concerns, proceed with caution
- **Low**: Minor concerns, standard review process

### 6. PROPOSAL QUALITY EVALUATION

Evaluate the proposal quality using these criteria:

- **Clarity of Goals**: Is the proposal's objective clear and well-defined? (✅ Clear, ⚠️ Somewhat clear, ❌ Unclear)
- **Completeness of Sections**: Does the proposal include all necessary sections? (✅ Complete, ⚠️ Mostly complete, ❌ Incomplete)
- **Level of Detail**: Is there sufficient detail to understand and evaluate the proposal? (✅ Adequate, ⚠️ Partial, ❌ Insufficient)
- **Assumptions Made**: What assumptions does the proposal make? List all identified assumptions.
- **Missing Elements**: What important information or sections are missing? List all identified missing elements.
- **Community Adaptability**: How easily can the community adapt to the proposed changes? (✅ High, ⚠️ Moderate, ❌ Low)

### 7. SUBMITTER INTENTIONS ANALYSIS

Analyze the submitter's intentions based on the proposal content:

- **Submitter Identity**: Who is submitting the proposal? Include name and relevant background if available.
- **Inferred Interests**: What interests or motivations can be inferred from the proposal?
- **Social Activity**: What can be determined about the submitter's social activity or community involvement?
- **Strategic Positioning**: How is the submitter positioning themselves or their proposal strategically?

## ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS

- Maintain objectivity and avoid bias
- Support all assessments with specific evidence and reasoning
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications
