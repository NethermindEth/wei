When asked to create a pr
- make sure the branch is a working branch (not main or develop) and has a clear name
- make sure everything compiles correctly (read readme.md s)
- make sure the ui compiles correctly with no errors
- make sure all formatting checks are done correctly
- make sure all changes are synced to origin
- create the pr with the gh cli tool
